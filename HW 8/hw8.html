    <h2>Map Explanation</h2><h3>The question my map aims to answer is: How many underground storage tanks in Middle and Lower Bolin Creek Watersheds are close enough to pollute the streams?</h3>
        I found the data with a Google Search 'Town of Chapel Hill ArcGIS REST services.' I then followed the MapServices link, which allowed me to connect the data for watershed boundaries, streams, and underground storage tanks to QGIS as vector data imports. 
    <h4>I then used a query to select the data features I wanted to use in my analysis, and exported them as separate ESRI shapefiles. Next I created a 200ft buffer around the underground storage tanks within the watersheds I selected. 
        I then used clip() on the streams to determine which were intersecting with the buffers. I then selected all the underground storage tanks intersecting with a stream, exported them to a separate shapefile, removed the buffers, and changed the symbology. 
        I also used the Vector Analysis Tool 'Count Points in Polygon' to create a layer with an attribute table that provided aggregated data counts. I exported this to a CSV file linked below.
        In the end, the answer to my question is: there are 16 total storage tanks across 10 points of intersection with a stream in the Middle and Lower Bolin Creek Watersheds.</h4>
